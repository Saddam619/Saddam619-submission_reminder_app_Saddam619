Reminder App Creation 

This is an explanation of how my reminder app  is all created. The script goes by asking your name at first. Once you put your name there, it will create a folder for you called submission_remider_<your name>. So this is going to be the kind of folder that will store all the essential files and scripts we need.

In addition to that, within the folder, the script is creating smaller folders that are named app, modules, assets and config. However, each one of it has a different specialization like the app folder has the main script which then sends reminder calls. Secondly, modules has extra helper functions while assets is a folder of students' submissions. Lastly, config will keep the fundamental settings as well. 

 
Moreover, the script also manages to create significant files that each one of it also in charge of different tasks. The first file is called reminder.sh which ensures who has turned in their work and if not sends reminder. There is another file which named function.sh and it does help to read all the names of people and see who hasn't submitted their work yet. The script also creates another file called submission.txt which lists the name of the students, their assignments and whether they have submitted it yet. Second to the last, there is a config file which shows what the assignment is and how many days are remaining to submit it,. Ultimately, the startup.sh file starts the reminder program. 

In conclusion, the script makes sure to run them all and finally, it tells you that everything is done. So, this is an app that reminds students what assignment needs to be done at what time.
